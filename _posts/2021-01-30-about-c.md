# About "C"

C is the boy in our CP. I think he was the victim of the bad ending. Here are some things about him that I believe to be true.

This boy has had a crush on [H](about-h) since at least his second year of junior high school. After a long crush, C revealed his romantic feelings to her on her 16th birthday. He got a positive answer from her then. But it only took her a few days to change her mind and dump him. This was the first girl he had ever liked and confessed his love for. Her behaviour hurt him. From then on, she even ignored him. We both felt it was very unfair.  As [we said earlier](starting-with-why), we are "defending justice". This is one of the reasons why CSA keep going.

We wish this very handsome boy all the luck in the world. We are sure you feel the same way.
