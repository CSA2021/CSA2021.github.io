# What will we do

As mentioned in an [earlier article](what-we-tried), I'm afraid we're going to "forgo". It means that we no longer have any action of substance. We will look back and look forward, recalling the sweet moments of the CP. We regard these memories as valuable assets.

In this year's graduation season, C&H may have gone their separate ways. At that time we will cease our activities completely. But this precious memory will be preserved. Those were the years of their youth, and ours. We look forward to the future and continue to wish them well.

**To our youth that will eventually pass away.**
