# About "H"

C is the girl in our CP. She makes it difficult to evaluate. She is the one we liked, and the one who broke up our CP with her own hands. She said yes to C's confession, and then dumped him. She seems to be the CSA's worst enemy and the one we are paying all the attention to.H is really a very conflicted character. But we will still keep an eye on her.
