# Starting with why

For justice.

Yes, we are defending justice. We have repeatedly encountered protests from one of them. Before, we had backed off. We closed our website and stopped our activities. We could only follow the CP in silence. But now we have decided not to back down and we are going to speak up and point out that this is not fair to some people.

**We will not rest until we have won in order to realise this noble idea.**

If you want to know more, keep following us.
